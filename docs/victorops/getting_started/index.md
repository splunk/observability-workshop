## Activate your login

You should have received an invitation to Activate your VictorOps account via e-mail, click the _Activate Account_ link and follow the prompts.

If you did not receive an invitation it is probably because you already have a VictorOps login, linked to a different organisation.

If so login to to that Org, then use the organisation dropdown next to your username in the top left to switch to the AppDev-EMEA Org.

If you have forgotten your password go to the sign-in page and use the forgotten password link to reset your password.
