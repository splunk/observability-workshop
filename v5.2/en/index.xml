In order to simplify the workshop modules, a pre-configured AWS/EC2 instance is provided.
The instance is pre-configured with all the software required to deploy the Splunk OpenTelemetery Connector2 in Kubernetes, deploy a NGINX3 ReplicaSet4 and finally deploy a microservices based application which has been instrumented using OpenTelemetry to send metrics, traces, spans and logs5.</description></item><item><title>Splunk APM</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.2/en/apm/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.2/en/apm/index.html</guid><description>Splunk APM is a NoSample™ Full-fidelity application performance monitoring and troubleshooting solution for cloud-native, microservices-based applications.
By collecting all traces, instead of a sampled subset, no anomaly goes undetected. Whether a user experiences an error or longer-than-usual latency, you’ll be able to know and act on it within seconds. Furthermore, not all bad behavior results in errors — as your developers create new applications they need to know whether their canary releases provide the expected results.</description></item><item><title>Splunk RUM</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.2/en/rum/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.2/en/rum/index.html</guid><description>Splunk RUM is the industry’s only end to end, full fidelity Real User Monitoring solution.

With Splunk Synthetic Monitoring, technical and business teams create detailed tests to proactively monitor the speed and reliability of websites, web apps, and resources over time, at any stage in the development cycle.
Splunk Synthetic Monitoring offers the most comprehensive and in-depth capabilities for uptime and web performance optimization as part of the only complete observability suite, Splunk Observability Cloud.</description></item><item><title>Splunk OnCall</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.2/en/oncall/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.2/en/oncall/index.html</guid><description>Aim This module is simply to ensure you have access to the Splunk On-Call UI (formerly known as VictorOps), Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring UI (formerly known as SignalFx) and the EC2 Instance which has been allocated to you.
Once you have access to each platform, keep them open for the duration of the workshop as you will be switching between them and the workshop instructions.
1. Activate your Splunk On-Call Login You should have received an invitation to Activate your Splunk On-Call account via e-mail, if you have not already done so, click the Activate Account link and follow the prompts.</description></item><item><title>.conf23 Workshops</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.2/en/conf/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.2/en/conf/index.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Other Workshops</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.2/en/other/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.2/en/other/index.html</guid><description>PetClinic Java WorkshopA workshop using Zero Configuration Auto-Instrumentation for Java

They have all the features enabled to successfully run any of the available workshops.
Step 1: Configure Your Org Using SWIPE SWIPE is an online tool to help configure the workshop environment in Observability Cloud and is available here. Please note, SWIPE does not provision EC2 instances - these are provisioned using Splunk Show (see step 2 below).</description></item></channel></rss>
