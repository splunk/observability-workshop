This ensures that MELT data collected via OpenTelemetry can be efficiently utilized for alerting, dashboarding, and troubleshooting purposes. It also ensures that users of Splunk Observability Cloud can quickly find the data they’re looking for.
Naming conventions also ensure that data can be aggregated effectively.</description></item></channel></rss>
