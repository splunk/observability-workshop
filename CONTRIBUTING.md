# Contributing to the Observability Workshop

When working on the workshop, we advise that you review your changes locally before committing them. Use the `hugo server` command to live preview your changes (as you type) on your local machine.

## Cloning the repo and installing dependencies

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/signalfx/observability-workshop.git
cd observability-workshop
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Running the docs server

In most cases, the default settings with `hugo server` work well, and Hugo is available at <http://localhost:1313>. If you need to change the port, you can do so by passing the `--port` flag e.g. `hugo server --port=1314`.

The documentation built from your current branch is then accessible through your favorite browser at <http://localhost:1314>.

## Optimising images

Install `optipng` e.g. `brew install optipng` and then run the following command in the `static/images` directory:

```bash
find . -type f -iname "*.png" -exec optipng -nb -nc {} \;
```

## Test release build locally

Build a release with

```bash
./.github/ci/build_site
```

The output will be in `./site/vdev`.

To run a webserver that mimics GitHub Pages, install [devd][devd], e.g. with `brew install devd`.

Then run

```bash
devd /observability-workshop/vdev/=./site/vdev /=./site/vdev
```

and visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to inspect the site.
