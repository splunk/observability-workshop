The aim of this module is for you to configure two example Rotations, and assign Team Members to the Rotations.
Navigate to the Rotations tab on the Teams sub menu, you should have no existing Rotations so we need to create some.
The 1st Rotation you will create is for a follow the sun support pattern where the members of each shift provide cover during their normal working hours within their time zone.</description></item><item><title>Configure Escalation Policies</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.70/en/unsupported-field-workshops/10-oncall/getting_started/escalation/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.70/en/unsupported-field-workshops/10-oncall/getting_started/escalation/index.html</guid><description>Aim Escalation policies determine who is actually on-call for a given team and are the link to utilizing any rotations that have been created.
The aim of this module is for you to create three different Escalation Policies to demonstrate a number of different features and operating models.

Note that routing keys are case insensitive and should only be composed of letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.
