The exported JSON from the Chrome DevTools Recorder will then be used to create a Splunk Synthetic Monitoring Real Browser Test.
In addition, you will also get to learn other Splunk Synthetic Monitoring checks like API Test and Uptime Test.
Pre-requisites Google Chrome Browser installed Access to Splunk Observability Cloud</description></item><item><title>API Test</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.32/en/other/synthetics-scripting/2-api-test/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.32/en/other/synthetics-scripting/2-api-test/index.html</guid><description>The API Test provides a flexible way to check the functionality and performance of API endpoints. The shift toward API-first development has magnified the necessity to monitor the back-end services that provide your core front-end functionality.
Whether you&amp;rsquo;re interested in testing the multi-step API interactions or you want to gain visibility into the performance of your endpoints, the API Test can help you accomplish your goals.</description></item></channel></rss>
