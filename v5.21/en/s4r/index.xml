Introduction The goal of this workshop is to experience an issue and use Splunk Observability Cloud to troubleshoot and identify the root cause. For this, we have provided a complete microservices-based application running in Kubernetes that has been instrumented to send metrics, traces, and logs to Splunk Observability Cloud.
2. OpenTelemetry A Quick introduction to why OpenTelemetry and why is it important for Observability.
3. A tour of the Splunk Observability User Interface A walkthrough of the various components of Splunk Observability Cloud showing you how to easily navigate the 5 main components:- APM, RUM, Log Observer, Synthetics and Infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>What is OpenTelemetry &amp; why should you care?</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/2-opentelemetry/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/2-opentelemetry/index.html</guid><description>OpenTelemetry With the rise of cloud computing, microservices architectures, and ever-more complex business requirements, the need for Observability has never been greater. Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by examining its outputs. In the context of software, this means being able to understand the internal state of a system by examining its telemetry data, which includes metrics, traces, and logs.
To make a system observable, it must be instrumented.</description></item><item><title>UI - Quick Tour 🚌</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/3-initial-tour/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/3-initial-tour/index.html</guid><description>We are going to start with a short walkthrough of the various components of Splunk Observability Cloud. The aim of this is to get you familiar with the UI.
Signing in to Splunk Observability Cloud Real User Monitoring (RUM) Application Performance Monitoring (APM) Log Observer Synthetics Infrastructure Monitoring Tip The easiest way to navigate through this workshop is by using:
the left/right arrows (&amp;lt; | &amp;gt;) on the top right of this page the left (◀️) and right (▶️) cursor keys on your keyboard</description></item><item><title>Let's go shopping 💶</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/4-online-boutique/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/4-online-boutique/index.html</guid><description>The purpose of this exercise is for you to interact with the Online Boutique web application. This is a sample application that is used to demonstrate the capabilities of Splunk Observability Cloud. The application is a simple e-commerce site that allows you to browse items, add them to your cart, and then checkout.
The application will already be deployed for you and your instructor will provide you with a link to the Online Boutique website.</description></item><item><title>Splunk RUM</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/5-rum/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/5-rum/index.html</guid><description>We are going to examine the real user data that has been provided by the telemetry received from all participants&amp;rsquo; browser sessions. The goal is to find a browser, mobile or tablet session that performed poorly and begin the troubleshooting process.</description></item><item><title>Splunk APM</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/6-apm/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/6-apm/index.html</guid><description>Discover the power of full end-to-end visibility by jumping from a RUM trace (front-end) to an APM trace (back-end). All the services are sending telemetry (traces and spans) that Splunk Observability Cloud can visualize, analyze and use to detect anomalies and errors.
RUM and APM are two sides of the same coin. RUM is the client-side view of the application and APM is the server-side view. In this section, we will use APM to drilldown and identify where the problem is.</description></item><item><title>Splunk Log Observer</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/7-log-observer/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/7-log-observer/index.html</guid><description>Using the content related to the APM trace (logs) we will now use Splunk Log Observer to drill down further to understand exactly what the problem is.
Related Content is a powerful feature that allows you to jump from one component to another and is available for metrics, traces and logs.</description></item><item><title>Splunk Synthetics</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/8-synthetics/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/8-synthetics/index.html</guid><description>Wouldn’t it be great if we could have 24/7 monitoring of our application, and be alerted when there is a problem? This is where Synthetics comes in. We will show you a simple test that runs every 1 minute and checks the performance and availability of a typical user journey through the Online Boutique.</description></item><item><title>Custom Service Health Dashboard 🏥</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/9-custom-dashboard/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/9-custom-dashboard/index.html</guid><description>It is common for development and SRE teams to require a summary of the health of their applications and/or services. More often or not these are displayed on wall-mounted TVs. Splunk Observability Cloud has the perfect solution for this by creating custom dashboards.
In this section we are going to build a Service Health Dashboard we can use to display on teams&amp;rsquo; monitors or TV screens.</description></item><item><title>Workshop Wrap-up 🎁</title><link>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/10-wrap-up/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://splunk.github.io/observability-workshop/v5.21/en/s4r/10-wrap-up/index.html</guid><description>Congratulations, you have completed the Splunk4Rookies Observability Workshop.
