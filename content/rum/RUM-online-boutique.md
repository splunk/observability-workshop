## 1. URL of RUM enabled Online Boutique

As discussed in the previous section we are going to use the Online Boutique running on the separate RUM host.

We are all connected to the Online Boutique running on the specific RUM host for this session. This will create more traffic from multiple locations, making the data more realistic.

You should have received the correct URL from your workshop host at this point.
Open a new web browser and go to `http://{==RUM-HOST-EC2-IP==}:81/` where you will then be able to see the RUM enabled Online Boutique running.

## 2. Generate traffic

The goal of this exercise is for you to browse the RUM enabled Online Boutique and buy different products and different quantities.
For extra credit, you may even use the url from different browsers or from your smartphone.

This will create  multiple sessions to investigate. Take your time to examine and buy the various products and put them in your cart:
