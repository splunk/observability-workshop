{{% notice icon="user" style="orange" title="Persona" %}}

Remaining in your **back-end developer** role, you need to inspect the logs from your application to determine the root cause of the issue.

{{% /notice %}}

Using the content related to the APM trace (logs) we will now use Splunk Log Observer to drill down further to understand exactly what the problem is.

Related Content is a powerful feature that allows you to jump from one component to another and is available for **metrics**, **traces** and **logs**.
