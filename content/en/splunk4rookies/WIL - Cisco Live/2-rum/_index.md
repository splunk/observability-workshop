We are going to examine the real user data that has been provided by the telemetry received from all workshop attendees browser sessions. The goal is to find a browser, mobile or tablet session that performed poorly and begin the troubleshooting process.

To do this, open the following url in a new browser window : **[https://app.eu0.signalfx.com/#/home/EsGF1sXAEAA](https://app.eu0.signalfx.com/#/home/EsGF1sXAEAA)**

This presents you with the login screen of Splunk Observability Cloud, and use the following login credentials, then click the **Sign In** button:
