You are a **frontend engineer**, or an **SRE** tasked to do the first triage of a performance issue. You have been asked to investigate a potential customer satisfaction issue with the Online Boutique application.

> [!splunk] We are going to look at the *Real User Monitoring* (**RUM**) data generated by you and your fellow attendees while using the Online Boutique. The goal is to find a browser, mobile or tablet session that performed poorly and begin the troubleshooting process.
