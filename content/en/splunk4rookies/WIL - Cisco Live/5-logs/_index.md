Remaining in your **back-end developer** role, you need to inspect the logs from your application to determine the root cause of the issue.

> [!splunk] Using the content related to the **APM** trace (logs) we will now use **Logs** to drill down further to understand exactly what the problem is. Related Content is a powerful feature that allows you to jump from one component to another and is available for **metrics**, **traces** and **logs**.
