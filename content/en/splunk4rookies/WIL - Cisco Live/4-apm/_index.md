You are a **back-end developer** and you have been called in to help investigate an issue found by the SRE. The SRE has identified a poor user experience and has asked you to investigate the issue.

> [!splunk] Discover the power of full end-to-end visibility by jumping from a RUM trace (front-end) to an APM trace (back-end). All the services are sending telemetry (traces and spans) that Splunk Observability Cloud can visualize, analyze and use to detect anomalies and errors.
> RUM and APM are two sides of the same coin. RUM is the client-side view of the application and APM is the server-side view. In this section, we will use APM to drill down and identify where the problem is.
