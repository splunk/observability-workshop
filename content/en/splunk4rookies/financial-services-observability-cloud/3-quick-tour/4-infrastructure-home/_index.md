Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (IM) is a market-leading monitoring and observability service for hybrid cloud environments. Built on a patented streaming architecture, it provides a **real-time** solution for engineering teams to visualize and analyze performance across infrastructure, services, and applications in a fraction of the time and with greater accuracy than traditional solutions.

**OpenTelemetry standardization:** Gives you full control over your data — freeing you from vendor lock-in and implementing proprietary agents.  
**Splunk’s OTel Collector:** Seamless installation and dynamic configuration, auto-discovers your entire stack in seconds for visibility across clouds, services, and systems.  
**300+ Easy-to-use OOTB content:** Pre-built navigators and dashboards, deliver immediate visualizations of your entire environment so that you can interact with all your data in real time.  
**Kubernetes navigator:** Provides an instant, comprehensive out-of-the-box hierarchical view of nodes, pods, and containers. Ramp up even the most novice Kubernetes user with easy-to-understand interactive cluster maps.  
**AutoDetect alerts and detectors:** Automatically identify the most important metrics, out-of-the-box, to create alert conditions for detectors that accurately alert from the moment telemetry data is ingested and use real-time alerting capabilities for important notifications in seconds.  
**Log views in dashboards:** Combine log messages and real-time metrics on one page with common filters and time controls for faster in-context troubleshooting.  
**Metrics pipeline management:** Control metrics volume at the point of ingest without re-instrumentation with a set of aggregation and data-dropping rules to store and analyze only the needed data. Reduce metrics volume and optimize observability spend.
