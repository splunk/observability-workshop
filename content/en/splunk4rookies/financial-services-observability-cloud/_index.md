In this workshop, we’ll demonstrate how Splunk Observability Cloud delivers value to our financial services customers due to its ability to provide real-time, full-fidelity, AI-powered monitoring across your entire digital ecosystem from infrastructure to applications to user experiences. It’s purpose-built for modern, cloud-native, microservices-based environments. You’ll have the opportunity to explore some of the platform’s most powerful features, which set it apart from other observability solutions: 

- **Infrastructure Monitoring**
- **Complete end-to-end trace visibility with NoSample Full-fidelity Application Performance Monitoring (APM)** 
- **No-code log querying** 
- **Root cause analysis with tag analytics and error stacks** 
- **Related Content for seamless navigation between components**

One of the core strengths of Splunk Observability Cloud is its ability to unify telemetry data, creating a comprehensive picture of both the end-user experience and your entire application stack.  

The workshop will focus on a microservices-based Wire transfer application deployed on Kubernetes. Users can initiate a wire transfer and all of the appropriate checks for user, balance, and compliance will be handled. This application is fully instrumented with OpenTelemetry to capture detailed performance data. 

**What is OpenTelemetry?**  
OpenTelemetry is an open-source collection of tools, APIs, and software development kits (SDKs) designed to help you instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data—such as metrics, traces, and logs. This data enables in-depth analysis of your software’s performance and behavior.

The OpenTelemetry community is growing rapidly, supported by leading companies like Splunk, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. It currently has the second-largest number of contributors within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, following only Kubernetes.
