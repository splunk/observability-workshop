## 1. Configuring Muting Rules

There will be times when you might want to mute certain notifications. For example, if you want to schedule downtime for maintenance on a server or set of servers, or if you are testing new code or settings etc. For that you can use muting rules in Splunk Observability Cloud. Let's create one!

Click on the ![alerts and detectors button](../../../images/alerts-and-detectors.png) from the navbar and then click **Detectors** to see your list of active detectors. You can filter for yours if you want.

![detectors list](../../../images//detectors.png) 

If you created an detector in **Creating a Detector** you can click on the three dots **`...`** on the far right for that detector; if not, do that for another detector.

From the drop-down click on **Create Muting Rule...**

![Create Muting Rule](../../../images//create-muting-rule.png)

In the **Muting Rule** window check **Mute Indefinitely** and enter a reason.

{{% alert title="Important" color="primary" %}}
This will mute the notifications permanently until you come back here and un-check this box or resume notifications for this detector.
{{% /alert %}}

![Mute Indefinitely](../../../images//mute-indefinitely.png)

Click **Next** and in the new modal window confirm the muting rule setup.

![Confirm Rule](../../../images//confirm-rule.png)

Click on {{% labelbutton color="ui-button-blue" %}}**Mute Indefinitely**{{% /labelbutton %}} to confirm.

![List muted rule](../../../images//alert-muted.png)

You won't be receiving any email notifications from your detector until you resume notifications again. Let's now see how to do that!

## 2. Resuming notifications

To Resume notifications, click on **Muting Rules**, you will see the name of the detector you muted notifications for under **Detector** heading.

Click on the thee dots **`...`** on the far right, and click on **Resume Notifications**.

![Resume](../../../images//muting-list.png)

Click on {{% labelbutton color="ui-button-blue" %}}**Resume**{{% /labelbutton %}} to confirm and resume notifications for this detector.

![Resume](../../../images//resume.png)

**Congratulations!** You have now resumed your alert notifications!
