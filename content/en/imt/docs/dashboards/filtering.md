## 1 Creating a new chart

Let's now create a new chart and save it in our dashboard!

Select the plus icon (top right of the UI) and from the drop down, choose the option **Chart**.
Or click on the {{< labelbutton >}}+ New Chart{{< /labelbutton >}} Button to create a new chart.

![Create new chart](../../../images/M-Filter-0.png)

You will now see a chart template like the following.

![Empty Chart](../../../images/M-Editing-6.png)

Let's enter a metric to plot. We are still going to use the metric **`demo.trans.latency`**.

In the **Plot Editor** tab under **Signal** enter **`demo.trans.latency`**.

You should now have a familiar line chart. Please switch the time to 15 mins.

## 2. Filtering and Analytics

Let's now select the **Paris** datacenter to do some analytics - for that we will use a filter.

Let's go back to the **Plot Editor** tab and click on {{% labelbutton color="ui-button-blue" %}}Add Filter{{% /labelbutton %}}
, wait until it automatically populates, choose **`demo_datacenter`**, and then **`Paris`**.

![Filter](../../../images/M-Filter-1.png)

In the **F(x)** column, add the analytic function **`Percentile:Aggregation`**, and leave the value to **`95`** (click outside to confirm).

![Analytics](../../../images/M-Filter-2.png)

For info on the **Percentile** function and the other functions see [Chart Analytics](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/data-visualization/charts/gain-insights-through-chart-analytics.html#gain-insights-through-chart-analytics).

## 3. Using Timeshift analytical function

Let's now compare with older metrics. Click on **`...`** and then on **Clone** in the dropdown to clone Signal **A**.

![Clone Signal](../../../images/M-Filter-3.png)

You will see a new row identical to **A**, called **B**, both visible and plotted.

![Plot Editor](../../../images/M-Filter-4.png)

For Signal **B**, in the **F(x)** column add the analytic function **Timeshift** and enter **`1w`** (or 7d for 7 days), and click outside to confirm.

![Timeshift](../../../images/M-Filter-5.png)

Click on the cog on the far right, and choose a **Plot Color** e.g. pink, to change color for the plot of **B**.

![Change Plot Colour](../../../images/M-Filter-6.png)

Click on **Close**.

We now see plots for Signal **A** (the past 15 minutes) as a blue plot, and the plots from a week ago in pink.

In order to make this clearer we can click on the **Area chart** icon to change the visualization.

![Area Chart](../../../images/M-Filter-8.png)

We now can see when last weeks latency was higher!

Next, click into the field next to **Time** on the Override bar and choose **`Past Hour`** from the dropdown.

## 4. Using Formulas

Let's now plot the difference of all metric values for a day with 7 days in between.

Click on {{% labelbutton color="ui-button-blue" %}}Enter Formula{{% /labelbutton %}}
 then enter **`A-B`** (A minus B) and hide (deselect) all Signals using the eye, except **C**.

![Formulas](../../../images/M-Filter-11.png)

We now see only the difference of all metric values of **A** and **B** being plotted. We see that we have some negative values on the plot because a metric value of **B** has some times larger value than the metric value of **A** at that time.

Lets look at the Signalflow that drives our Charts and Detectors!
