Let's now save our chart.

## 1. Save to existing dashboard

Check that you have **YOUR_NAME-Dashboard: YOUR_NAME-Dashboard** in the top left corner.

This means you chart will be saved in this Dashboard.

Name the Chart **Latency History** and add a Chart Description if you wish.

## 2. Copy and Paste a chart

Click on the three dots **`...`** on the **Latency History** chart in your dashboard and then on **Copy**.

You see the chart being copied, and you should now have a red circle with a white 1 next to the **+** on the top left of the page.

Click on the ![red one](../../../images/M-MoreCharts-4.png) at the top of the page, and then in the menu on *Paste Charts* (There should also be a red dot with a 1 visible at the end of the line).

## 3. Edit the pasted chart

Click on the three dots **`...`** on on of the **Latency History** charts in your dashboard and then on **Open** (or you can click on the name of the chart which here is **Latency History**).

This will bring you to the editor environment again.

First set the time for the chart to -1 hour in the Time box at the top right of the chart. Then to make this a different chart, click on the eye icon in front of signal "*A*" to make it visible again, and then hide signal "*C*" via the eye icon and change the name for *Latency history* to **Latency vs Load**.

Add the filter for the *demo_datacenter:Paris*, then change the Rollup type by clicking on the **Configure Plot** button and changing the roll-up from **Auto (Delta)** to **Rate/sec**. Change the name from **demo.trans.count** to **Latency vs Load**.
