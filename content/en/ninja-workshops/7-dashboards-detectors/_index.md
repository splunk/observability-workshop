Welcome to the workshop on **Dashboards** in the Splunk Observability Cloud. This session is designed to help you get hands-on experience with building insightful visualizations.

<!-- Welcome to the workshop on **Dashboards and Detectors** in the Splunk Observability Cloud. This session is designed to help you get hands-on experience with building insightful visualizations and setting up proactive monitoring using built-in capabilities. -->

We’ll be working with existing demo data available in the Splunk Observability Suite. You can follow along using any **trial** or **production** Splunk Observability organization that you have access to.

### What You’ll Learn
