Please use your own name in the following format to give your dashboard a name e.g. **YOUR_NAME-Dashboard**.

Please replace **YOUR_NAME** with your own name, change the dashboard permissions to *Restricted Read and Write access*, and verify your user can read/write.

You should see you own login information displayed, meaning you are now the only one who can edit this dashboard. Of course you have the option to add other users or teams from the drop box below that may edit your dashboard and charts.  

For now make sure you change it back to ***Everyone can Read or Write*** to remove any restrictions.

It is common practice to link dashboards that are relevant to a Team to a teams page. So let's add your dashboard to the team page for easy access later. Use the ![dashboards button](../../images/dashboards.png?classes=inline&height=25px) from the navbar again.

This will bring you to your teams dashboard, We use the team ***Example Team*** as an example here, the workshop one will be different.

Press the {{< button style="white" >}}+{{< /button >}} *Add Dashboard Group* button to add you dashboard to the team page.

This will bring you to the **Select a dashboard group to link to this team** dialog.
Type your name (that you used above) in the search box to find your Dashboard. Select it so its highlighted and click the **Ok** button to add your dashboard.
