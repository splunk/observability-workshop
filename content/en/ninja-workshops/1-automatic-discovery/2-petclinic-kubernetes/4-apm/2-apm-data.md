In the left-hand menu click on **APM** to see the data generated by the traces from the newly instrumented services. Change the **Environment** filter **(1)** to the name of your workshop instance in the dropdown box. (Note: this will be **`<INSTANCE>-workshop`** where **`INSTANCE`** is the value from the shell script you ran earlier. Ensure it is the only one selected.)

If you see a Critical Alert, you can ignore it as it is caused by the sudden request increase generated by the load generator **(2)**. Click on the **Service Map** **(3)** pane to get ready for the next section.
