As we have seen in the previous chapter, you can trace your interactions between the various services using APM without touching your code, which will allow you to identify issues faster.

However, besides tracing **automatic discovery and configuration** offers additional features out of the box that can help you find issues even faster. In this section we are going to look at two of them:

- **Always-on Profiling and Java Metrics**
- **Database Query Performance**

If you want to dive deeper into Always-on Profiling or DB-Query performance, we have a separate Ninja Workshop called [**Debug Problems in Microservices**](/en/scenarios/debug_problems/) that you can follow.
