The goal of this workshop is to help you become comfortable creating and modifying OpenTelemetry Collector configuration files. You’ll start with a minimal `agent.yaml` file and gradually configure several common advanced scenarios.

The workshop also explores how to configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to store telemetry data locally instead of transmitting it to a third-party vendor backend. Furthermore, this approach significantly enhances the debugging and troubleshooting process and is useful for testing and development environments where you don’t want to send data to a production system.

To get the most out of this workshop, you should have a basic understanding of the OpenTelemetry Collector and its configuration file format. Additionally, proficiency in editing YAML files is required. The entire workshop is designed to run locally.

### Workshop Overview

During this workshop, we will cover the following topics:

- **Setting up the agent locally**: Add metadata, and introduce the debug and file exporters.
- **Configuring a gateway**: Route traffic from the agent to the gateway.
- **Configuring the Filelog receiver**: Collect log data from various log files.
- **Enhancing agent resilience**: Basic configurations for fault tolerance.
- **Configuring processors**:
  - Filter out noise by dropping specific spans (e.g., health checks).
  - Remove unnecessary tags, and handle sensitive data.
  - Transform data using OTTL in the pipeline before exporting.
- **Configuring Connectors**: Route data to different endpoints based on the values received.

By the end of this workshop, you'll be familiar with configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector for a variety of real-world use cases.

### Prerequisites

- **Create a directory** on your machine for the workshop (e.g., `advanced-otel`). We will refer to this directory as `[WORKSHOP]` in the instructions.
- **Download the latest OpenTelemetry Collector release** for your platform and place it in the `[WORKSHOP]` directory:

| Platform                         | Binary URL          |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|
|  Apple Mac (Apple Silicon)   | **[otelcol_darwin_arm64](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/releases/download/v0.117.0/otelcol_darwin_arm64)** |
|  Apple Mac (Intel)           | **[otelcol_darwin_amd64](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/releases/download/v0.117.0/otelcol_darwin_amd64)** |
|  Windows AMD/64              | **[otelcol_windows_amd64.exe](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/releases/download/v0.117.0/otelcol_windows_amd64.exe)** |
|  Linux (AMD/64)              |**[otelcol_linux_amd64](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/releases/download/v0.117.0/otelcol_linux_amd64)** |
|  Linux (ARM/64)              |**[otelcol_linux_arm64](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/releases/download/v0.117.0/otelcol_linux_arm64)** |

Once downloaded, rename the file to `otelcol` (or `otelcol.exe` on Windows). On Mac and Linux, update the file permissions to make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x otelcol
```

Mac users must trust the executable when running `otelcol` for the first time. For more details, refer to [**Apple's support page**](https://support.apple.com/en-mide/102445).

For this workshop, using a good YAML editor like [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) will be beneficial.

Additionally, having access to [**jq**](https://jqlang.org/download/) is recommended. This lightweight command-line tool helps process and format JSON data, making it easier to inspect traces, metrics, and logs from the OpenTelemetry Collector.
