## Wrap-Up

We hope you enjoyed this workshop, which provided hands-on experience deploying and working
with several of the technologies that are used to monitor Cisco AI PODs with
Splunk Observability Cloud. Specifically, you had the opportunity to:

* Work with a RedHat OpenShift cluster with GPU-based worker nodes.
* Work with the NVIDIA NIM Operator and NVIDIA GPU Operator.
* Work with Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed using NVIDIA NIM to the cluster.
* Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector in the Red Hat OpenShift cluster.
* Add Prometheus receivers to the collector to ingest infrastructure metrics.
* Monitor the Weaviate vector database in the cluster.
* Configure monitoring for Pure Storage metrics using Prometheus. 
* Instrument Python services that interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) with OpenTelemetry.
* Understand which details which OpenTelemetry captures in the trace from applications that interact with LLMs.
