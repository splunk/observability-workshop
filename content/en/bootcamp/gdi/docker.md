Dockerize the service. Use this `Dockerfile` as a skeleton:

```docker
ARG APP_IMAGE=python:3
FROM $APP_IMAGE as base

FROM base as builder
WORKDIR /app
RUN python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install --no-cache-dir -U pip setuptools
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

FROM base
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app /app
COPY app.py .

ENV PATH="/app/.venv/bin:$PATH"
```

Add the [appropriate `CMD`][docker-cmd] at the end to launch the app.

Stop other instances of the app if you had any running.

Then build and run the image:

=== "Shell Command"

    ```bash
    docker build . -t wordcount
    docker run -p 5000:5000 wordcount:latest
    ```

Test the service in another shell:

=== "Shell Command"

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/wordcount -F text=@hamlet.txt
    ```

The milestone for this task is `05docker`.
