#### Introduction

The goal of this workshop is to experience an issue and use Splunk Observability Cloud to troubleshoot and identify the root cause. For this, we have provided a complete microservices-based application running in Kubernetes that has been instrumented to send **metrics, traces, and logs** to Splunk Observability Cloud.

#### Who should attend?

Those wanting to gain an understanding of Splunk Observability in a hands-on environment. This workshop is designed for people with little or no experience with Splunk Observability.

#### What you’ll need

Just you, your laptop, and a browser that can access external websites. We run these workshops in person or on Zoom, if you don’t have the Zoom client on your device you will be able to access them via a web browser.

#### What's covered in this workshop?

This 3-hour session will take you through the basics of Splunk Observability, the only observability platform with **streaming analytics**, **NoSample™ Full Fidelity** distributed tracing in a hands-on environment.

##### OpenTelemetry

A Quick introduction to **why OpenTelemetry** and why is it important for Observability.

##### Tour of the Splunk Observability User Interface

A walkthrough of the various components of Splunk Observability Cloud showing you how to easily navigate the 5 main components:- **APM, RUM, Log Observer, Synthetics and Infrastructure**.

##### Generate Real User Data

Enjoy some retail therapy using the Online Boutique Website. Use your browser, mobile or tablet to spend some hard-earned virtual money to send **metrics _(do we have a problem?)_, traces _(where is the problem?)_ and logs _(what is the problem?)_**.

##### Splunk Real User Monitoring (RUM)

Examine the real user data that has been provided by the telemetry received from all participants' browser sessions. The goal is to find a browser, mobile or tablet session that performed poorly and begin the troubleshooting process.

##### Splunk Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

Discover the power of **full end-to-end visibility** by jumping from a RUM trace (front-end) to an APM trace (back-end). All the services are sending telemetry (traces and spans) that Splunk Observability Cloud can visualize, analyze and use to detect anomalies and errors.

##### Splunk Log Observer (LO)

Related Content is a powerful feature that allows you to jump from one component to another. In this case, we will jump from the APM trace to the logs to the related logs.

##### Splunk Synthetics

Wouldn’t it be great if we could have **24/7** monitoring of our application, and be **alerted** when there is a problem? This is where Synthetics comes in. We will show you a simple test that runs every 1 minute and checks the performance and availability of a typical user journey through the Online Boutique.
