In this workshop, we accomplished the following:

* We deployed our application and captured traces with **Splunk Observability Cloud**.
* We used **Database Query Performance** to find a slow-running query that impacted the game startup time.
* We enabled **AlwaysOn Profiling** and used it to confirm which line of code was causing the increased startup time and memory usage.
* We found another application performance issue and used **AlwaysOn Profiling** again to find the problematic line of code.
* We applied fixes for both of these issues and verified the result using **Splunk Observability Cloud**.

Enabling **AlwaysOn Profiling** and utilizing **Database Query Performance** for your applications will let you get even more value from the data you’re sending to **Splunk Observability Cloud**.  

Now that you’ve completed this workshop, you have the knowledge you need to start collecting deeper diagnostic data from your own applications!
