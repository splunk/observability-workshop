[Global variables](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/synthetics/test-config/global-variables.html) allow us to use stored strings in multiple tests, so we only need to update them in one place. 

View the global variable that we'll use to perform our API test. Click on **Global Variables** under the cog icon. The global variable named `env.encoded_auth` will be the one that we'll use to build the spotify API transaction.
