**Splunk Observability Cloud** includes powerful features that help central platform teams that are responsible for creating consistency, standards and best practices in an organization.

This workshop will go through some of the ways to apply standardization in your Observability practice.

We will cover:
* Collecting data with standards, and applying metadata at various points in the process
* Managing costs, by reviewing metrics and applying metrics pipeline management to it
* Configuring Observability-as-code, using terraform and api's

We will use a variety of scripts to demonstrate these examples. Be sure to pick a unique name, so your data won't cross over with anyone else taking the workshop at the same time.

Let's get started!
