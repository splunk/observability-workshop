Splunk RUM is the industry’s only end to end, full fidelity Real User Monitoring solution. It is built to optimize performance and aid in faster troubleshooting, giving you full visibility into end-user experiences.

Splunk RUM allows you to identify performance problems in your web applications that impact the customer experience. We support benchmarking and measuring page performance with core web vitals. This includes but not limited to: W3C timings, the ability to identify long running tasks, along with everything that can impact your page load.

With Splunk’s end to end monitoring capabilities you are able to view the latency between all of the services that make up your application, from the service itself through to infrastructure metrics such as database calls and everything in between.

Our full fidelity end to end monitoring solution captures 100% of your span data. We do not sample, we are framework agnostic and Open Telemetry standardized.

More often than not we find that the frontend and backend application's performance are interdependent. Fully understanding and being able to visualize the link between your backend services and your user experience is increasingly important.
To see the full picture, Splunk RUM provides seamless correlation between our front end and back end microservices. If your users are experiencing less than optimal conditions on your web based application due to an issue related to your microservice or infrastructure, Splunk will be able to detect this issue and alert you.

To complete the picture and offer full visibility, Splunk is also able to show in-context logs and events to enable deeper troubleshooting and root-cause analysis.
