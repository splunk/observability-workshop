## 1. Again select the cart URL

After you have focussed the time slot with the time selector, you need to reselect the *cart* url from **Url Name** view, as shown below:

In the example above we selected `http://34.246.124.162:81/cart`

## 2. Drill down in the Sessions

After you have analyzed the  information and drilled down via the Tag Spotlight to a subset of the traces, you can view the actual session as it was run by the end-user's browser.

You do this by clicking on the link **Example Sessions** as shown below:

![RUM-Header](../../images/RUM-ExampleSessions.png)

This will give you a list of sessions that matched both the time filter and the subset selected in the Tag Profile.

Select one  by clicking on the session ID, It is a good idea to select one that has the longest duration (preferably over 700 ms).

Once you have selected the session, you will be taken to the session details page. As you are selecting a specific action that is part of the session, you will likely arrive somewhere in the middle of the session, at the moment of the interaction.

You can see the URL `http://34.246.124.162:81/cart`, the one you selected earlier, is where we are focusing on in the session stream.

Scroll down a little bit on the page, so you see the end of the operation as shown below.

You can see that we have received a few Javascript Console errors that may not have been detected or visible to the end users. To examine these in more detail click on the middle one  that says: ***Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Prcie')**

This will cause the page to expand and show the Span detail for this interaction, It will contain a detailed *error.stack* you can pass on the developer to solve the issue. You may have noticed when buying in the Online Boutique that the final total always was $0.00.
