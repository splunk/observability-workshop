Splunk APM is a NoSample™ Full-fidelity application performance monitoring and troubleshooting solution for cloud-native, microservices-based applications.

By collecting all traces, instead of a sampled subset, no anomaly goes undetected. Whether a user experiences an error or longer-than-usual latency, you’ll be able to know and act on it within seconds. Furthermore, not all bad behavior results in errors — as your developers create new applications they need to know whether their canary releases provide the expected results. Only by collecting all trace data will you ensure that your cloud-native applications behave the way they are supposed to.

Infrastructure and application performance are interdependent. To see the full picture, Splunk APM provides seamless correlation between cloud infrastructure and the microservices running on top of it. If your application acts out because of memory leakage, a noisy neighbor container or any other infrastructure-related issue, Splunk will let you know. To complete the picture, in-context access to Splunk logs and events enable deeper troubleshooting and root-cause analysis.
