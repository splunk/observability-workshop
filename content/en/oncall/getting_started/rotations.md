# Configure Rotations

## Aim

A rotation is a recurring schedule, that consists of one or more shifts, with members who rotate through a shift.

The aim of this module is for you to configure two example Rotations, and assign Team Members to the Rotations.

---

Navigate to the **Rotations** tab on the **Teams** sub menu, you should have no existing Rotations so we need to create some.

The 1st Rotation you will create is for a follow the sun support pattern where the members of each shift provide cover during their normal working hours within their time zone.

The 2nd will be a Rotation used to provide escalation support by more experienced senior members of the team, based on a 24/7, 1 week shift pattern.

## 1. Follow the Sun Support - Business Hours

Click **Add Rotation**

The first user added will be the 'current' user for that shift.

You can re-order the shifts by simply dragging the users up and down, and you can change the current user by clicking `Set Current` on an alternate user

You will now have three different Shift patterns, that provide cover 24hr hours, Mon - Fri, but with no cover at weekends.

We will now add another Rotation for our Senior SRE Escalation cover.
