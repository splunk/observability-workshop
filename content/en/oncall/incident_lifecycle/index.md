# UI Overview

## Aim

The aim of this module is for you to get more familiar with the Timeline Tab and the filtering features.

---

## 1. Timeline

The aim of Splunk On-Call is to _**"Make On Call Suck Less"**_, and it does this by getting the critical data, to the right people, at the right time.

The key to making it work for you is to centralize all your alerting sources, sending them all to the Splunk On-Call platform, then you have a single pane of glass in which to manage all of your alerting.

Login to the Splunk On-Call UI and select the **Timeline** tab on the main menu bar, you should have a screen similar to the following image:

## 2. People

On the left we have the **People** section with the **Teams** and **Users** sub tabs.

On the **Teams** tab, click on **All Teams** then expand _**[Your Teamname]**_.

Users with the Splunk On-Call Logo against their name are currently on call.

Here you can see who is on call within a particular Team, or across all Teams via **Users â†’ On-Call**.

If you click into one of the currently on call users, you can see their status.

It shows which Rotation they are on call for, when their current Shift ends and their next Shift starts (times are displayed in your timezone), what contact methods they have and which Teams they belong to (dummy users such as Hank do not have Contact Methods configured).

## 3. Timeline

In the centre **Timeline** section you get a realtime view of what is happening within your environment with the newest messages at the top.

Here you can quickly post update messages to make your colleagues aware of important developments etc.

You can filter the view using the buttons on the top toolbar showing only update messages, GitHub integrations, or apply more advanced filters.

Lets change the Filters settings to streamline your view. Click the **Filters** button then within the **Routing Keys** tab change the **Show** setting from **all routing keys** to **selected routing keys**.

Change the **My Keys** value to **all** and the **Other Keys** value to **selected** and deselect all keys under the Other Keys section.

Click anywhere outside of the dialogue box to close it.

You will probably now have a much simpler view as you will not currently have Incidents created using your Routing Keys, so you are left with the other types of messages that the Timeline can display.

Click on **Filters** again, but this time switch to the **Message Types** tab.

Here you control the types of messages that are displayed.

For example, deselect **On-call Changes** and **Escalations**, this will reduce the amount of messages displayed.

## 4. Incidents

On the right we have the **Incidents** section.

Here we get a list of all the incidents within the platform, or we can view a more specific list such as incidents you are specifically assigned to, or for any of the Teams you are a member of.

Select the **Team Incidents** tab you should find that the **Triggered**, **Acknowledged** & **Resolved** tabs are currently all empty as you have had no incidents logged.

Let's change that by generating your first incident!

Continue with the [Create Incidents](../incident_lifecycle/create_incidents/) module.
