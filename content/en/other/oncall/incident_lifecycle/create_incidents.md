## Aim

The aim of this module is for you to place yourself 'On-Call' then generate an Incident using the supplied EC2 Instance so you can then work through the lifecycle of an Incident.

---

## 1. On-Call

Before generating any incidents you should assign yourself to the current Shift within your **Follow the Sun Support - Business Hours** Rotation and also place yourself **On-Call**.

* Click on the **Schedule** link within your **Team** in the **People** section on the left, or navigate to **Teams → [Your Team] → Rotations**
* Expand the **Follow the Sun Support - Business Hours** Rotation
* Click on the **Manage members** icon (the figures) for the current active shift depending on your time zone
![Manage Members](../../images/manage-members.png)
* Use the **Select a user to add...** dropdown to add yourself to the shift
* Then click on **Set Current** next to your name to make yourself the current **on-call** user within the shift
* You should now get a **Push Notification** to your phone informing you that **You Are Now On-Call**

## 2. Trigger Alert

Switch back to your shell session connected to your EC2 Instance; all of the following commands will be executed from your Instance.

Force the CPU to spike to 100% by running the following command:

``` text
openssl speed -multi $(grep -ci processor /proc/cpuinfo)
```

``` text
Forked child 0
+DT:md4:3:16
+R:19357020:md4:3.000000
+DT:md4:3:64
+R:14706608:md4:3.010000
+DT:md4:3:256
+R:8262960:md4:3.000000
+DT:md4:3:1024
```

This will result in an Alert being generated by Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring which in turn will generate an Incident within Splunk On-Call within a maximum of 10 seconds. This is the default polling time for the OpenTelemetry Collector installed on your instance (note it can be reduced to 1 second).

Continue with the [Manage Incidents](./manage_incidents) module.
