## Introduction

This workshop demonstrates how to use **Jenkins** to automate the deployment and lifecycle management of **AppDynamics Smart Agent** across multiple EC2 instances. Whether you're managing 10 hosts or 10,000, this guide shows you how to leverage Jenkins pipelines for scalable, secure, and repeatable Smart Agent operations.

## What You'll Learn

In this workshop, you'll learn how to:

- **Deploy Smart Agent** to multiple hosts simultaneously using Jenkins
- **Configure Jenkins credentials** for secure SSH and AppDynamics access
- **Create parameterized pipelines** for flexible deployment scenarios
- **Implement batch processing** to scale to thousands of hosts
- **Manage the complete agent lifecycle** - install, configure, stop, and cleanup
- **Handle failures gracefully** with automatic error tracking and reporting

## Key Features

- 🚀 **Parallel Deployment** - Deploy to multiple hosts simultaneously
- 🔄 **Complete Lifecycle Management** - Install, uninstall, stop, and clean agents
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code** - All pipelines version-controlled
- 🔐 **Secure** - SSH key-based authentication via Jenkins credentials
- 📈 **Massively Scalable** - Deploy to thousands of hosts with automatic batching
- 🎛️ **Jenkins Agent** - Executes within your AWS VPC
