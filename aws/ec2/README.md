# Instructions on how to set up EC2 cloud instances for participants

You will need access to an AWS account to obtain both **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** and **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**.

Initialise Terraform

```
terraform init -upgrade
```
Create environment variables for **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** and **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
```

Validate the environment variables are set

```
echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

Set the following variables:

- `aws_region`: Which region do you want the instances in?
- `aws_instance_type`: What kind of instance?
- `aws_instance_count`: How many instances?

You can also explicitly set variables as command line flags. Sample command:

```
terraform apply \
-auto-approve \
-var="aws_region=eu-central-1" \
-var="aws_instance_type=t2.xlarge" \
-var="aws_instance_count=1"
```
