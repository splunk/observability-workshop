Validate in the UI \u00b6 From the top left hamburger menu, click Infrastructure \u2192 Kubernetes . Use the Cluster dropdown so select your cluster, you should see the new pods started and containers deployed. When you click on your cluster in the Splunk UI you should have a view that looks like below: If you select the WORKLOADS tab again you should now see that there are a number of Deployments and ReplicaSets: 4. View Online Boutique \u00b6 The Online Boutique is viewable on port 81 of the EC2 instance's IP address. The IP address is the one you used to SSH into the instance at the beginning of the workshop. Open your web browser and go to http:// EC2-IP :81/ where you will then be able to see the Online Boutique running. 5. Generate traffic \u00b6 The Online Boutique deployment contains a container running Locust that we can use to generate load traffic against the website to generate metrics, traces and spans. Locust is available on port 82 of the EC2 instance's IP address. Open a new tab in your web browser and go to http:// EC2-IP :82/ , you will then be able to see the Locust running. Set the Spawn rate to be 2 and click Start Swarming , this will start a gentle continous load on the application. Now go to Dashboards \u2192 APM Services \u2192 Service . For this we need to know the name of your application environment. In this workshop all the environments use: hostname -apm-env . To find the hostname, on the AWS/EC2 instance run the following command: Shell Command echo \"Your APM environment is: $(hostname)-apm-env\" Output Example Your APM environment is: whul-apm-env Please select your environment you found in the previous step then select the frontend service and set time to -15m () With this automatically generated dashboard you can keep an eye out for the health of your service, it provides various performance related charts as well as relevant information on the underlying host and Kubernetes platform if applicable. Take some time to explore the various charts in this dashboard 6. Verify Splunk APM metrics \u00b6 From the top left hamburger menu, click APM, this will bring you to the APM Overview dashboard: Select the Explore on the right hand side and select your environment you found before and set the time to 15 minutes. This will show you the automatically generated Dependency/Service Map for the Online Boutique application. It should look similar to the screenshot below: The legend at the bottom of the page explains the different visualizations in the Dependency/Service Map. Service requests, error rate and root error rate. Request rate, latency and error rate Also in this view you can see the overall Error and Latency rates over time charts. 7. OpenTelemetry Dashboard \u00b6 Check the OpenTelemetry Collector dashboards and validate metrics and spans are being sent: 8. OpenTelemetry zpages \u00b6 To debug the traces being sent you can use the zpages extension.

Ordering & sizing of charts \u00b6 If you do not like the default order and sizes of your charts you can simply use window dragging technique to move and size them to the desired location Grab the top border of a chart and you should see the mouse pointer change to a drag icon. You can now simply drag you chart to the desired location. Now drag the Latency History Chart to site below the Latency vs Load Chart. You can also resize a chart, simply by draggin the side or the bottom. As a last exercise reduce the width of the note chart to about a third of the other charts. The chart will automatically snap to one of the sizes it supports. Widen the 3 other charts to about a third of the Dashboard.

Introduction \u00b6 Let's take a look at SignalFlow - the analytics language of Observability Cloud that can be used to setup monitoring as code. The heart of Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring is the SignalFlow analytics engine that runs computations written in a Python-like language. SignalFlow programs accept streaming input and produce output in real time. SignalFlow provides built-in analytical functions that take metric time series (MTS) as input, perform computations, and output a result MTS. Comparisons with historical norms, e.g. on a week-over-week basis Population overviews using a distributed percentile chart Detecting if the rate of change (or other metric expressed as a ratio, such as a service level objective) has exceeded a critical threshold Finding correlated dimensions, e.g. to determine which service is most correlated with alerts for low disk space Infrastructure Monitoring creates these computations in the Chart Builder user interface, which lets you specify the input MTS to use and the analytical functions you want to apply to them. You can also run SignalFlow programs directly by using the SignalFlow API . SignalFlow includes a large library of built-in analytical functions that take a metrics time series as an input, perform computations on its datapoints, and output time series that are the result of the computation.

Introduction \u00b6 Splunk Observability Cloud uses detectors, events, alerts, and notifications to keep you informed when certain criteria are met. For example, you might want a message sent to a Slack channel or to an email address for the Ops team when CPU Utilization has reached the 95th percentile, or when the number of concurrent users is approaching a limit that might require you to spin up an additional AWS instance. These conditions are expressed as one or more rules that trigger an alert when the conditions in the rules are met. Individual rules in a detector are labeled according to criticality: Info, Warning, Minor, Major, and Critical. 2. Creating a Detector \u00b6 In Dashboards click on your Custom Dashboard Group (that you created in the previous module) and then click on the dashboard name. We are now going to create a new detector from this chart. Once you see the chart, click on the bell icon on your chart and then on New Detector From Chart . In the text field next to Detector Name , ADD YOUR INITIALS before the proposed detector name. Naming the detector It's important that you add your initials in front of the proposed detector name. It should be something like this: XYZ's Latency Chart Detector . Click on Create Alert Rule In the Detector window, inside Alert signal , the Signal we will alert on is marked with a (blue) bell in the Alert on column. The bell indicates which Signal is being used to generate the alert. Click on Proceed to Alert Condition 3. Setting Alert condition \u00b6 In Alert condition , click on Static Threshold and then on Proceed to Alert Settings In Alert Settings , enter the value 290 in the Threshold field. In the same window change Time on top right to past day ( -1d ). 4. Alert pre-flight check \u00b6 A pre-flight check will take place after 5 seconds. See the Estimated alert count . Based on the current alert settings, the amount of alerts we would\u2019ve received in 1 day would have been approx. 18 . About pre-flight checks Once you set an alert condition, the UI estimates how many alerts you might get based on the current settings, and in the timeframe set on the upper right corner - in this case, the past day. Immediately, the platform will start analyzing the signals with the current settings, and perform something we call a Pre-flight Check. This enables you to test the alert conditions using the historical data in the platform, to ensure the settings are logical and will not inadvertently generate an alert storm, removing the guess work from configuring alerts in a simple but very powerful way, only available using the Splunk Observability Cloud. To read more about detector previewing, please visit this link Setting up detectors . Click on Proceed to Alert Message 5. Alert message \u00b6 In Alert message , under Severity choose Major .

An Organization needs to be pre-provisioned as a APM entitlement is required for the purposes of this module. Please contact someone from Splunk's Observability team to get a trial instance with APM enabled if you don\u2019t have one already. To check if you have an Organization with APM enabled, just login to Splunk's observability suite and check that you have the APM tab on the top navbar next to Dashboards. 1. AWS Lambda exercise & APM overview \u00b6 This workshop section is focused on developer's of serverless/Lambda application/functions. This workshop is going to guide them through the steps to add Tracing to Python and Node-Js Lambda Functions, and see traces flow from an on-prem Java application though the various Python and Node-Js Lambda Functions in Splunk APM. Splunk APM captures end-to-end distributed transactions from your applications, including serverless apps (Lambda's) with trace spans sent directly to Splunk or via an optional OpenTelemetry Collector that act as a central aggregation point prior to sending trace spans to Splunk. (recommended, and show in the workshop). In addition to proxying spans and infrastructure metrics, the OpenTelemetry Collector can also perform other functions, such as redacting sensitive tags prior to spans leaving your environment. The following illustration shows the recommended deployment model: Splunk's auto-instrumentation libraries send spans to the OpenTelemetry Collector; the OpenTelemetry Collector forwards the spans to Observability Cloud. 2. AWS Lambda exercise requirements flow \u00b6 During this workshop you will perform the following activities: Perform a test run of the Splunk Mobile Phone Web shop and its services Enable Tracing on local SpringBoot App Enable Tracing on First Python & Node-js Lambda Functions Enable Tracing on the other functions Enrich the spans Look at configuring options for the OpenTelemetry Collector 3.

To find the ones that are assigned to you, use the filter option with the the Unique ID you have been allocated, you should have something similar to: UID _RetailOrder UID _RetailOrderLine UID _RetailOrderPrice UID _RetailOrderDiscount (Where UID represents the Unique ID you have been provided - ACME in our example) 2. Verify CloudWatch Logs Location \u00b6 To investigate issues that may occur during the run, we need to check the CloudWatch logs. Open CloudWatch Log Groups in a new browser tab so you can easily switch between the Lambda Functions and the Logs. The activity to pick in CloudWatch is the Log Group section. If there are logs present, you can filter on your preset like before. The result should be that there are no logs visible (see below). If there are logs, even after filtering on your preset, make sure they are not related to the 4 service above, or delete them if possible).

There will be 4 Lambda Functions and 1 EC2 instance deployed for each participant. Every resource will be prefixed with a Unique ID (UID) to identify which attendee they belong to. Terraform is used to deploy all of the resources and this module details the steps required to install and configure terraform, configure it to authenticate with AWS, and then deploy the resources. 1. Install Terraform \u00b6 Terraform is used to deploy all of the AWS infrastructure for the workshop, so needs to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install Terraform can be found here . Terraform AWS Authentication \u00b6 Once Terraform is installed, you need to configure it to authenticate with your AWS Account. Details on AWS Authentication can be found here . The AWS Authentication consists of two files, config and credentials which are typically located in the ~/.ssh folder. The config file details different profiles, and works in conjunction with the credentials file which contains your access and secret keys. config [default] region = us-east-1 output = json [profile splunk] region = us-east-1 output = json authentication [default] aws_access_key_id = {your access key} aws_secret_access_key = {your secret key} [splunk] aws_access_key_id = {your access key} aws_secret_access_key = {your secret key} 2.

Resolving deltas: 100% (159/159), done. 2.2 Create terraform.tfvars \u00b6 A file called terraform.tfvars needs to be created and populated with your specific settings. This file contains all of the settings required to enable Terraform to connect to both your AWS and Splunk Environments. An example version of the file is included in the repo named terraform.tfvars.example , which you should copy and rename to terraform.tfvars . Run the following command from within the directory where the workshop content was download. crete terraform.tfvars cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars Then update the newly created terraform.tfvars starting with the AWS Variables Section. 2.2.1 AWS Variables Section \u00b6 profile should match the profile name used in your aws authentication file which Terraform will use to authenticate with AWS key_name is the name of the ssh_key you wish to use to access the EC2 instances (note password login is also enabled on the Instances) private_key_path is the path to your private ssh key, such as ~/.ssh/xxx.pem or ~/.ssh/id_rsa instance_type is the AWS Instance Type used for the EC2 Instances - this defaults to the free tier \"t2.micro\" region is an optional parameter, normally left commented out.

This file contains the Unique IDs which will be appended to each AWS Resource to identify which workshop participant they are allocated to. There is an example file in the repo called quantity.auto.tfvars.example which needs to be copied and renamed to quantity.auto.tfvars . Run the following command from within the directory where the workshop content was download. crete quantity.auto.tfvars cp quantity.auto.tfvars.example quantity.auto.tfvars Edit quantity.auto.tfvars and populate the list of participants, ensuring each value is unique and has no spaces. Ensure the function_count value equals the total number of names, and that each entry ends with a comma, apart from the last one, as per the example below. quantity.auto.tfvars function_count = \"3\" function_ids = [ \"John\", \"Sarah\", \"Amir\" ] 3. Initialize Terraform \u00b6 Once you have finished creating and updating xxx and yyy you now need to initialize terraform, so run the following command: Terraform init teraform init Example output Initializing the backend...

Please update your source in required_providers. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. 4. Deploy the Workshop \u00b6 4.1 Terraform Plan \u00b6 You can now deploy the workshop using Terraform. It is always best practice to run a plan so you can check what changes Terraform is going to make.

If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here: https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. 2. Create execution plan \u00b6 The terraform plan command creates an execution plan. By default, creating a plan consists of: Reading the current state of any already-existing remote objects to make sure that the Terraform state is up-to-date. Comparing the current configuration to the prior state and noting any differences. Proposing a set of change actions that should, if applied, make the remote objects match the configuration. The plan command alone will not actually carry out the proposed changes, and so you can use this command to check whether the proposed changes match what you expected before you apply the changes Shell Command terraform plan -var=\"access_token=$ACCESS_TOKEN\" -var=\"realm=$REALM\" -var=\"sfx_prefix=[$(hostname)]\" Example Output Plan: 92 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. If the plan executes successfully, we can go ahead and apply: 3. Apply execution plan \u00b6 The terraform apply command executes the actions proposed in the Terraform plan above. The most straightforward way to use terraform apply is to run it without any arguments at all, in which case it will automatically create a new execution plan (as if you had run terraform plan) and then prompt you to provide the Access Token, Realm (the prefix defaults to Splunk ) and approve the plan, before taking the indicated actions. Due to this being a workshop it is required that the prefix is to be unique so you need to run the terraform apply below. Shell Command terraform apply -var=\"access_token=$ACCESS_TOKEN\" -var=\"realm=$REALM\" -var=\"sfx_prefix=[$(hostname)]\" Example Output Apply complete! Resources: 92 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Once the apply has completed, validate that the detectors were created, under the Alerts \u2192 Detectors . They will be prefixed by the hostname of your instance. To check the prefix value run: Shell Command echo $(hostname) You will see a list of the new detectors and you can search for the prefix that was output from above. 3. Destroy all your hard work \u00b6 The terraform destroy command is a convenient way to destroy all remote objects managed by your Terraform configuration. While you will typically not want to destroy long-lived objects in a production environment, Terraform is sometimes used to manage ephemeral infrastructure for development purposes, in which case you can use terraform destroy to conveniently clean up all of those temporary objects once you are finished with your work. Now go and destroy all the Detectors and Dashboards that were previously applied! Shell Command terraform destroy -var=\"access_token=$ACCESS_TOKEN\" -var=\"realm=$REALM\" Example Output Destroy complete! Resources: 92 destroyed. Validate all the detectors have been removed by navigating to Alerts \u2192 Detectors Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter. Terraform generates an execution plan describing what it will do to reach the desired state, and then executes it to build the described infrastructure. As the configuration changes, Terraform is able to determine what changed and create incremental execution plans which can be applied. The infrastructure Terraform can manage includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc. \u21a9 A provider is responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources. Providers generally are an IaaS (e.g. Alibaba Cloud, AWS, GCP, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack), PaaS (e.g. Heroku), or SaaS services (e.g. Splunk, Terraform Cloud, DNSimple, Cloudflare). \u21a9","title":"Plan, Apply and Destroy"},{"location":"monitoring-as-code/#monitoring-as-code-lab-summary","text":"Use Terraform 1 to manage Observability Cloud Dashboards and Detectors Initialize the Terraform Splunk Provider 2 .

Comparing the current configuration to the prior state and noting any differences. Proposing a set of change actions that should, if applied, make the remote objects match the configuration. The plan command alone will not actually carry out the proposed changes, and so you can use this command to check whether the proposed changes match what you expected before you apply the changes Shell Command terraform plan -var=\"access_token=$ACCESS_TOKEN\" -var=\"realm=$REALM\" -var=\"sfx_prefix=[$(hostname)]\" Example Output Plan: 92 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Shell Command terraform apply -var=\"access_token=$ACCESS_TOKEN\" -var=\"realm=$REALM\" -var=\"sfx_prefix=[$(hostname)]\" Example Output Apply complete! Resources: 92 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Once the apply has completed, validate that the detectors were created, under the Alerts \u2192 Detectors . They will be prefixed by the hostname of your instance.

While you will typically not want to destroy long-lived objects in a production environment, Terraform is sometimes used to manage ephemeral infrastructure for development purposes, in which case you can use terraform destroy to conveniently clean up all of those temporary objects once you are finished with your work. Now go and destroy all the Detectors and Dashboards that were previously applied!

Validate all the detectors have been removed by navigating to Alerts \u2192 Detectors Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter. Terraform generates an execution plan describing what it will do to reach the desired state, and then executes it to build the described infrastructure. As the configuration changes, Terraform is able to determine what changed and create incremental execution plans which can be applied. The infrastructure Terraform can manage includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc. \u21a9 A provider is responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources. Providers generally are an IaaS (e.g. Alibaba Cloud, AWS, GCP, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack), PaaS (e.g. Heroku), or SaaS services (e.g. Splunk, Terraform Cloud, DNSimple, Cloudflare). \u21a9","title":"3.

Once you have access to each platform, keep them open for the duration of the workshop as you will be switching between them and the workshop instructions. 1. Activate your Splunk On-Call Login \u00b6 You should have received an invitation to Activate your Splunk On-Call account via e-mail, if you have not already done so, click the Activate Account link and follow the prompts. If you did not receive an invitation it is probably because you already have a Splunk On-Call login, linked to a different organisation. If so login to to that Org, then use the organisation dropdown next to your username in the top left to switch to the Observability Workshop Org. Note If you do not see the Organisation dropdown menu item next to your name with Observability Workshop EMEA that is OK, it simply means you only have access to a single Org so that menu is not visible to you. If you have forgotten your password go to the sign-in page and use the forgotten password link to reset your password. 2. Activate your Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring Login \u00b6 You should have received an invitation to join the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring - Observability Workshop. If you have not already done so click the JOIN NOW button and follow the prompts to set a password and activate your login. 3. Access your EC2 Instance \u00b6 Splunk has provided you with a dedicated EC2 Instance which you can use during this workshop for triggering Incidents the same way the instructor did during the introductory demo. This VM has Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring deployed and has an associated Detector configured. The Detector will pass Alerts to Splunk On-Call which will then create Incidents and page the on-call user. The welcome e-mail you received providing you all the details for this Workshop contain the instructions for accessing your allocated EC2 Instance. SSH (Mac OS/Linux) \u00b6 Most attendees will be able to connect to the workshop by using SSH from their Mac or Linux device. To use SSH, open a terminal on your system and type ssh ubuntu@x.x.x.x (replacing x.x.x.x with the IP address found in your welcome e-mail). When prompted Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? please type yes . Enter the password provided in the welcome e-mail. Upon successful login you will be presented with the Splunk logo and the Linux prompt. At this point you are ready to continue with the workshop when instructed to do so by the instructor Putty (Windows users only) \u00b6 If you do not have ssh preinstalled or if you are on a Windows system, the best option is to install putty, you can find the downloads here . Important If you cannot install Putty, please go to Web Browser (All) . Open Putty and in the Host Name (or IP address) field enter the IP address provided in the welcome e-mail. You can optionally save your settings by providing a name and pressing Save . To then login to your instance click on the Open button as shown above.

Contact Methods \u00b6 Switch to the Splunk On-Call UI and click on your login name in the top right hand corner and chose Profile from the drop down. Confirm your contact methods are listed correctly and add any additional phone numbers and e-mail address you wish to use. 2. Mobile Devices \u00b6 To install the Splunk On-Call app for your smartphone search your phones App Store for Splunk On-Call to find the appropriate version of the app. The publisher should be listed as VictorOps Inc. Configuration help guides are available: Apple Android Install the App and login, then refresh the Profile page and your device should now be listed under the devices section. Click the Test push notification button and confirm you receive the test message. 3. Personal Calendar \u00b6 This link will enable you to sync your on-call schedule with your calendar, however as you do not have any allocated shifts yet this will currently be empty. You can add it to your calendar by copying the link into your preferred application and setting it up as a new subscription. 4. Paging Policies \u00b6 Paging Polices specify how you will be contacted when on-call. The Primary Paging Policy will have defaulted to sending you an SMS assuming you added your phone number when activating your account. We will now configure this policy into a three tier multi-stage policy similar to the image below. Step 1: Send a push notification \u00b6 Click the edit policy button in the top right corner for the Primary Paging Policy. Send a push notification to all my devices Execute the next step if I have not responded within 5 minutes Click Add a Step Step 2: Send an e-mail \u00b6 Send an e-mail to [your email address] Execute the next step if I have not responded within 5 minutes Click Add a Step Step 3: Call your number \u00b6 Every 5 minutes until we have reached you Make a phone call to [your phone number] Click Save to save the policy. When you are on-call or in the escalation path of an incident, you will receive notifications in this order following these time delays. To cease the paging you must acknowledge the incident. Acknowledgements can occur in one of the following ways: Expanding the Push Notification on your device and selecting Acknowledge Responding to the SMS with the 5 digit code included Pressing 4 during the Phone Call Slack Button For more information on Notification Types, see here . 5. Custom Paging Policies \u00b6 Custom paging polices enable you to override the primary policy based on the time and day of the week. A good example would be get the system to immediately phone you whenever you get a page during the evening or weekends as this is more likely to get your attention than a push notification. Create a new Custom Policy by clicking Add a Policy and configure with the following settings: 5.1 Custom evening policy \u00b6 Policy Name: Evening Every 5 minutes until we have reached you Make a phone call to [your phone number] Time Period: All 7 Days Timezone Between 7pm and 9am Click Save to save the policy then add one more. 5.2 Custom weekend policy \u00b6 Policy Name: Weekend Every 5 minutes until we have reached you Make a phone call to [your phone number] Time Period: Sat & Sun Timezone Between 9am and 7pm Click Save to save the policy. These custom paging policies will be used during the specified times in place of the Primary Policy. However admins do have the ability to ignore these custom policies, and we will highlight how this is achieved in a later module. The final option here is the setting for Recovery Notifications. As these are typically low priority simply sending you an email or a push notification are the typical settings used. Your profile is now fully configured using these example configurations.

Timeline \u00b6 The aim of Splunk On-Call is to \"Make On Call Suck Less\" , and it does this by getting the critical data, to the right people, at the right time. The key to making it work for you is to centralize all your alerting sources, sending them all to the Splunk On-Call platform, then you have a single pane of glass in which to manage all of your alerting. Login to the Splunk On-Call UI and select the Timeline tab on the main menu bar, you should have a screen similar to the following image: 2. People \u00b6 On the left we have the People section with the Teams and Users sub tabs. On the Teams tab, click on All Teams then expand [Your Teamname] . Users with the Splunk On-Call Logo against their name are currently on call. Here you can see who is on call within a particular Team, or across all Teams via Users \u2192 On-Call . If you click into one of the currently on call users, you can see their status. It shows which Rotation they are on call for, when their current Shift ends and their next Shift starts (times are displayed in your timezone), what contact methods they have and which Teams they belong to (dummy users such as Hank do not have Contact Methods configured). 3. Timeline \u00b6 In the centre Timeline section you get a realtime view of what is happening within your environment with the newest messages at the top. Here you can quickly post update messages to make your colleagues aware of important developments etc. You can filter the view using the buttons on the top toolbar showing only update messages, GitHub integrations, or apply more advanced filters. Lets change the Filters settings to streamline your view. Click the Filters button then within the Routing Keys tab change the Show setting from all routing keys to selected routing keys . Change the My Keys value to all and the Other Keys value to selected and deselect all keys under the Other Keys section. Click anywhere outside of the dialogue box to close it. You will probably now have a much simpler view as you will not currently have Incidents created using your Routing Keys, so you are left with the other types of messages that the Timeline can display. Click on Filters again, but this time switch to the Message Types tab. Here you control the types of messages that are displayed. For example, deselect On-call Changes and Escalations , this will reduce the amount of messages displayed. 4. Incidents \u00b6 On the right we have the Incidents section. Here we get a list of all the incidents within the platform, or we can view a more specific list such as incidents you are specifically assigned to, or for any of the Teams you are a member of.

Then on the Web UI, navigate back to Timeline , select Team Incidents on the right, then select Acknowledged and click into the new Incident , this will open up the War Room Dashboard view of the Incident. You should now have the Details tab displayed on both your Phone and the Web UI. Notice how they both show the exact same information. Now select the Annotations tab on both the Phone and the Web UI, you should have a Graph displayed in the UI which is generated by Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring. On your phone you should get the same image displayed (sometimes it's a simple hyperlink depending on the image size) Splunk On-Call is a 'Mobile First' platform meaning the phone app is full functionality and you can manage an incident directly from your phone. For the remainder of this module we will focus on the Web UI however please spend some time later exploring the phone app features. 3. Link to Alerting System \u00b6 Sticking with the Web UI, click the 2. Alert Details in SignalFx link. This will open a new browser tab and take you directly to the Alert within Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring where you could then progress your troubleshooting using the powerful tools built into its UI. However, we are focussing on Splunk On-Call so close this tab and return to the Splunk On-Call UI. 4. Similar Incidents \u00b6 What if Splunk On-Call could identify previous incidents within the system which may give you a clue to the best way to tackle this incident. The Similar Incidents tab does exactly that, surfacing previous incidents allowing you to look at them and see what actions were taken to resolve them, actions which could be easily repeated for this incident. 5 Timeline \u00b6 On right we have a Time Line view where you can add messages and see the history of previous alerts and interactions. 6 Add Responders \u00b6 On the far left you have the option of allocating additional resources to this incident by clicking on the Add Responders link. This allows you build a virtual team specific to this incident by adding other Teams or individual Users, and also share details of a Conference Bridge where you can all get together and collaborate. Once the system has built up some incident data history, it will use Machine Learning to suggest Teams and Users who have historically worked on similar incidents, as they may be best placed to help resolve this incident quickly. You can select different Teams and/or Users and also choose from a pre-configured conference bridge, or populate the details of a new bridge from your preferred provider. We do not need to add any Responders in this exercise so close the Add Responders dialogue by clicking Cancel . 7 Reroute \u00b6 If it's decided that maybe the incident could be better dealt with by a different Team, the call can be Rerouted by clicking the Reroute Button at the top of the left hand panel. In a similar method to that used in the Add Responders dialogue, you can select Teams or Users to Reroute the Incident to. We do not need to actually Reroute in this exercise so close the Reroute Incident dialogue by clicking Cancel . 8 Snooze \u00b6 You can also snooze this incident by clicking on the alarm clock Button at the top of the left hand panel. You can enter an amount of time upto 24 hours to snooze the incident. This action will be tracked in the Timeline, and when the time expires the paging will restart. This is useful for low priority incidents, enabling you to put them on a back burner for a few hours, but it ensures they do not get forgotten thanks to the paging process starting again. We do not need to actually Snooze in this exercise so close the Snooze Incident dialogue by clicking Cancel . 9 Action Tracking \u00b6 Now lets fix this issue and update the Incident with what we did. Add a new message at the top of the right hand panel such as Discovered rogue process, terminated it . All the actions related to the Incident will be recorded here, and can then be summarized is a Post Incident Review Report available from the Reports tab 10 Resolution \u00b6 Now kill off the process we started in the VM to max out the CPU by switching back the Shell session for the VM and pressing ctrl+c Within no more than 10 seconds SignalFx should detect the new CPU value, clear the alert state in SignalFx, then automatically update the Incident in VictorOps marking it as Resolved . As we have two way integration between Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring and Splunk On-Call we could have also marked the incident as Resolved in Splunk On-Call, and this would have resulted in the alert in Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring being resolved as well.

Assuming you are using the AppDev EMEA instance of VictorOps you will find the VictorOps Integration has already been configured so there is no need to create a new one. However the process of creating a new Integration is simply to click on Create New Integration like in the image below, or if there are existing integrations and you want to add another one you would click New Integration . Enter a descriptive Name then paste the Service_API_Endpoint value you copied in the previous step into the Post URL field, then save it. Handling multiple VictorOps integrations SignalFx can integrate with multiple VictorOps accounts so it is important when creating one to use a descriptive name and to not simply call it VictorOps.

Q: Alerts v. Incident Response v. Incident Management \u00b6 A: Alerts, Incident Response and Incident Management are related functions. Together they comprise the incident response and resolution process. Monitoring and Observability tools send alerts to incident response platforms. Those platforms take a collection of alerts and correlate them into incidents. Those incidents are recorded into incident management (ITSM) platforms for record. Alerts are the trigger that something has happened, and provide context to an incident. Incidents consist of the alert payload, all activity associated with the incident from the time it was created, and the on-call policies to be followed. ITSM is the system of record for incidents that are active and after they have been resolved. All these components are necessary for successful incident response and management practices. On-Call Q: Is Observability Monitoring \u00b6 A: The key difference between Monitoring and Observability is the difference between \u201cknown knowns\u201d and \u201cunknown knowns\u201d respectively. In monitoring the operator generally has prior knowledge of the architecture and elements in their system. They can reliably predict the relationship between elements, and their associated metadata. Monitoring is good for stateful infrastructure that is not frequently changed. Observability is for systems where the operators ability to predict and trace all elements in the system and their relationships is limited. Observability is a set of practices and technology, which include traditional monitoring metrics. These practices and technologies combined give the operator the ability to understand ephemeral and highly complex environments without prior knowledge of all elements of a system. Observability technology can also account for fluctuations in the environment, and variation in metadata (cardinality) better than traditional monitoring which is more static. Observability Q: What are Traces and Spans \u00b6 A: Traces and spans, combined with metrics and logs, make up the core types of data that feed modern Observability tools. They all have specific elements and functions, but work well together. Because microservices based architectures are distributed, transactions in the system touch multiple services before completing. This makes accurately pinpointing the location of an issue difficult. Traces are a method for tracking the full path of a request through all the services in a distributed system. Spans are the timed operations in each service. Traces are the connective tissue for the spans and together they give more detail on individual service processes. While metrics give a good snapshot of the health of a system, and logs give depth when investigating issues, traces and spans help navigate operators to the source of issues with greater context. This saves time when investigating incidents, and supports the increasing complexity of modern architectures. APM Q: What is the Sidecar Pattern \u00b6 A: The sidecar pattern is a design pattern for having related services contected directly by infrastructure. Related services can be adding functionality or supporting the application logic they are connected to. It is used heavily as a method for deploying agents associated with the management plan along with the application service they support. In Observability the sidecar services are the application logic, and the agent collecting data from that service. The setup requires two containers one with the application service, and one running the agent. The containers share a pod, and resources such as disk, network, and namespace. They are also deployed together and share the same lifecycle.

They all have specific elements and functions, but work well together. Because microservices based architectures are distributed, transactions in the system touch multiple services before completing. This makes accurately pinpointing the location of an issue difficult. Traces are a method for tracking the full path of a request through all the services in a distributed system. Spans are the timed operations in each service. Traces are the connective tissue for the spans and together they give more detail on individual service processes. While metrics give a good snapshot of the health of a system, and logs give depth when investigating issues, traces and spans help navigate operators to the source of issues with greater context. This saves time when investigating incidents, and supports the increasing complexity of modern architectures.

Related services can be adding functionality or supporting the application logic they are connected to. It is used heavily as a method for deploying agents associated with the management plan along with the application service they support. In Observability the sidecar services are the application logic, and the agent collecting data from that service. The setup requires two containers one with the application service, and one running the agent. The containers share a pod, and resources such as disk, network, and namespace. They are also deployed together and share the same lifecycle.

Introduction to Teams \u00b6 To make sure that users see the dashboards and alerts that are relevant to them when using Observability Cloud, most organizations will use Observability Cloud's Teams feature to assign a member to one or more Teams. Ideally, this matches work related roles, for example, members of a Dev-Ops or Product Management group would be assigned to the corresponding Teams in Observability Cloud. When a user logs into Observability Cloud, they can choose which Team Dashboard will be their home page and they will typically select the page for their primary role. In the example below, the user is a member of the Development, Operations and Product Management Teams, and is currently viewing the Dashboard for the Operations Team. This Dashboard has specific Dashboard Groups for NGINX, Infra and K8s assigned but any Dashboard Group can be linked to a Teams Dashboard. They can use the menu along the top left to quickly navigate between their allocated teams, or they can use the ALL TEAMS dropdown on the right to select specific Team Dashboards, as well as quickly accessing ALL Dashboards using the adjacent link. Alerts can be linked to specific Teams so the Team can monitor only the Alerts they are interested in, and in the above example they currently have 1 active Critical Alert. The Description for the Team Dashboard can be customized and can include links to team specific resources (using Markdown). 2. Creating a new Team \u00b6 To work with to Splunk's Team UI click on the hamburger icon top left and select the Organizations Settings \u2192 Teams . When the Team UI is selected you will be presented with the list of current Teams. To add a new Team click on the Create New Team button. This will present you with the Create New Team dialog. Create your own team by naming it [YOUR-INITIALS]-Team and add yourself by searching for your name and selecting the Add link next to your name. This should result in a dialog similar to the one below: You can remove selected users by pressing Remove or the small x . Make sure you have your group created with your initials and with yourself added as a member, then click Done This will bring you back to the Teams list that will now show your Team and the one's created by others. Note The Teams(s) you are a member of have a grey Member icon in front of it. If no members are assigned to your Team, you should see a blue Add Members link instead of the member count, clicking on that link will get you to the Edit Team dialog where you can add yourself. This is the same dialog you get when pressing the 3 dots ... at the end of the line with your Team and selecting Edit Team The ... menu gives you the option to Edit, Join, Leave or Delete a Team (leave and join will depend on if you are currently a member). 3. Adding Notification Rules \u00b6 You can set up specific Notification rules per team, click on the Notification Policy tab, this will open the notification edit menu. By default the system offers you the ability to set up a general notification rule for your team. Note The Email all team members option means all members of this Team will receive an email with the Alert information, regardless of the alert type. 3.1 Adding recipients \u00b6 You can add other recipients, by clicking Add Recipient . These recipients do not need to be Observability Cloud users. However if you click on the link Configure separate notification tiers for different severity alerts you can configure every alert level independently. Different alert rules for the different alert levels can be configured, as shown in the above image. Critical and Major are using Splunk's VictorOps Incident Management solution. For the Minor alerts we send it to the Teams Slack channel and for Warning and Info we send an email. 3.2 Notification Integrations \u00b6 In addition to sending alert notifications via email, you can configure Observability Cloud to send alert notifications to the services shown below.

Access Tokens \u00b6 If you wish to control the consumption of Hosts, Containers, Custom Metrics and High Resolution Metrics, you can create multiple Access Tokens and allocate them to different parts of your organization. In the UI click on the hamburger top left and select the Organizations Settings \u2192 Access Tokens The Access Tokens Interface provides an overview of your allotments in the form of a list of Access Tokens that have been generated. Every Organization will have a Default token generated when they are first setup, but there will typically be multiple Tokens configured. Each Token is unique and can be assigned limits for the amount of Hosts, Containers, Custom Metrics and High Resolution Metrics it can consume. The Usage Status Column quickly shows if a token is above or below its assigned limits. 2. Creating a new token \u00b6 Let create a new token by clicking on the New Token button. This will provide you with the Name Your Access Token dialog. Enter the new name of the new Token by using your Initials e.g. RWC-Token and make sure to tick both Ingest Token and API Token checkboxes! After you press OK , you will be taken back to the Access Token UI, here your new token should be present, among the ones created by others. If you have made an error in your naming, want to disable/enable a token or set a Token limit, click on the ellipsis ( ... ) menu button behind a token limit to open the manage token menu. If you made a typo you can use the Rename Token option to correct the name of your token. 3. Disabling a token \u00b6 If you need to make sure a token cannot be used to send Metrics in you can disable a token. Click on Disable to disable the token, this means the token cannot be used for sending in data to Splunk Observability Cloud. The line with your token should have become greyed out to indicate that is has been disabled as you can see in the screenshot below. Go ahead and click on the ellipsis ( ... ) menu button to Disable and Enable your token. 4. Manage token usage limits \u00b6 Now Lets start limiting usage by clicking on Manage Token Limit in the 3 ... menu. This will show the Manage Token Limit Dialog: In this Dialog you can set the limits per category. Please go ahead and specify the limits as follows for each usage metric: Limit Value Host Limit 5 Container Limit 15 Custom Metric Limit 20 High Resolution Metric Limit 0 For our lab use your own email address, and double check that you have the correct numbers in your dialog box as shown in the table above. Token limits are used to trigger an alert that notify one or more recipients when the usage has been above 90% of the limit for 5 minutes. To specify the recipients, click Add Recipient , then select the recipient or notification method you want to use (specifying recipients is optional but highly recommended). The severity for token alerts is always Critical. Click on Update to save your Access Tokens limits and The Alert Settings. Going above token limit When a token is at or above its limit in a usage category, new metrics for that usage category will not be stored and processed by Observability Cloud. This will make sure you there will be no unexpected cost due to a team sending in data without restriction. Advanced alerting If you wish to get alerts before you hit 90%, you can create additional detectors using whatever values you want. These detectors could target the Teams consuming the specific Access Tokens so they can take action before the admins need to get involved. In your company you would distribute these new Access Tokens to various teams, controlling how much information/data they can send to Observability Cloud. This will allow you to fine tune the way you consume your Observability Cloud allotment and prevent overages from happening. Congratulations!
